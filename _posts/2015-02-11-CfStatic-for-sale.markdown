It has been a long while since I made any updates to [CfStatic](https://github.com/DominicWatson/cfstatic). The reasons for this are simple. We don't use it at work, [Sticker](https://github.com/pixl8/sticker) suits our needs better.

I still believe in what CfStatic has to offer, but lack the impetus to see it progress.

So, anyone up for the challenge of taking it on and moving it forward?

Dominic
