My name is Dominic Watson and I am a web developer who primarily codes using [Lucee](http://lucee.org). I am the technical lead at [Pixl8 Interactive](http://www.pixl8.co.uk). This is my blog.

I am the proud father of Greta, guardian and best buddy of Will and very lucky husband to my incredibly talented wife, [Greta and Will's mummy](http://www.theimagegarden.co.uk/).

I contribute to and create a bit of OSS from time to time, mostly at GitHub. You can find all my projects and contributions on my [GitHub profile page](https://github.com/DominicWatson).

If I see something I like, I'll often tweet about it from my [Twitter profile]('https://twitter.com/dom_watson') (I might also chime into other conversations every so often).
